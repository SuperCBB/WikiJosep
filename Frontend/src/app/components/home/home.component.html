<p>Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad. Oh boy, so you actually learned something today? What is this? Full House? I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me killed by Nazis. I think you need to think ahead and live in the moment. Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. No! Look away! I'm making an egg, Mom! Ugh…! I'm making an egg!

    Oh god, oh, I blame myself. Oh, what a tragedy. Oh, well, he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid. You know what shy pooping is, Rick? You little monster! I thought you were masturbating! Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it.
    
    Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady. It's called carpe diem Morty. Look it up. I can finally go on that trip I've been talking about. You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is?
    
    We're gonna nine eleven this bitch unless Morty gets better math grades! And that's the wayyy, the news goes! Oh god, oh, I blame myself. Oh, what a tragedy. Oh, well, he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
    
    Burgertime! Don't break an arm jerking yourself off Morty. What the fuck is going on?! Lick, lickity, lick my balls!
    
    God-damn! Don't break an arm jerking yourself off Morty. Return it? Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty! Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus! I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back. So now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty. Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty. And you're gonna be part of them. And together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna- do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever a hundred times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. www.rickandmorty.com. www.rickandmortyadventures.

    This is it, Morty! It's full circle from the pilot! Full circle! … Oh, I guess we, uh… I guess we both just had to take a shit. I wish that shotgun was my penis. It’s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick!
    
    He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away! Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different? No more dad, Morty. Flip the pickle over. Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo.
    
    You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Snuffles was my slave name. You can call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. Puffy vagina.
    
    Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor!
